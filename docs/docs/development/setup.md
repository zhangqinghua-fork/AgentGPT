# üõ†Ô∏è Setup

The following document will help you set up a local installation of AgentGPT.

## Stack

- üíÖ Frontend: NextJS + Typescript
- üêç Backend: FastAPI + Python
- üìö DB: MySQL through docker with the option of running SQLite locally

## Interactive Setup

We've recently launched an interactive setup tool that will guide you through creating an ENV and running AgentGPT.

- You will need node intalled you can check by running 'node -v' or install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

Simply run the following on a unix system:

```
git clone https://github.com/reworkd/AgentGPT.git && cd AgentGPT
./setup.sh
```

If you are on windows, you can do the following after downloading the repo:

```
setup.bat
```

Going this route, you can ignore the below text.

## ENV

Before you can get started, you need to ensure your ENV is correctly configured. To do this, copy over
the [.env.example](https://github.com/reworkd/AgentGPT/blob/main/.env.example) file into the `./next/` directory, rename
it to `.env` and update values as necessary. Some things to note:

- You will need to update the `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your own value. See the [FAQ](/faq) for details
- The DB ENV values are taken from definitions in `./docker-compose.yml`

:::note Increasing Max Loops

If you want to increase the max loops you agent has locally this can be done by modifying `REWORKD_PLATFORM_MAX_LOOPS`
variable in your `platform/.env` file. It can also be done by directly modifying the platform's source
code in `settings.py` (not recommended).

**Note**: Running a large number of loops locally can be result in a higher OpenAI bill.

## Using Docker

The docker build is very straightforward and should work out of the box.
Ensure you have docker installed by visiting [their website](https://www.docker.com/). After this, run the following
command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will spin up a container for the frontend, backend, and database.

## Developing outside of docker

Outside of docker, you'll need to just configure your ENV. Additionally, you can use `setup.sh` to walkthrough ENV
configuration and also update your Prisma configuration to point to a local SQLite
instance.

After this, you can run the following to set up your Next.js project. We will add additional instructions for the Python
backend when enabled.

```bash
// Frontend
cd ./next
npm install
npm run dev
```

In a different window, you can run the following to start the backend:

```bash
// Backend. Make sure you are at the root of the project
cd ./platform
poetry install
poetry run python -m reworkd_platform
```

## Running the site

After you have locally built AgentGPT, you can travel to http://localhost:3000/ in your web browser.

## Issues / Additional help

If you're still having trouble, you can follow a legacy guide from
